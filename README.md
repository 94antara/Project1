# Project1
In this project we made a web page where you can put your postal code to find the nearby convenience stores around you.

I used HTML to structure the page, made sure proper label is used for zipcode and input a "find" button.
I used basic CSS to present the page.

In Javascript, I took API from google and put in a function to integrate the key into the page.
